<center><img src="icon.png"/><h1>xPOKE</h1><h3>Tokenizing in-server currencies of PokémonShowdown.</h3><h2>#PlayToEarn, inspired by Axie Infinity, implemented in an traditional game.</h2></center>
<h4>In-server currencies of Pokémon Showdown's servers (the servers that have their own currencies (such as indigo.psim.us, dawn.psim.us, hispano.psim.us, etc), even these that xPOKE doesn't controls), convertible to their "wrapped/pegged"/tokenized form (xPOKE).
xPOKE uses Ethereum's layer2 XDai network.</h4>
<h4>The DAO that can mint tokens has been decentralized a bit, with its minting capabilities granted to an multisignature Gnosis vault (the hot wallet is also multisig, but less safe than the vault multisig, but also holding less amounts, as supposed for an hot wallet). Soon it will be more decentralized, with chatbots as oracles and an smart-contract autonomously responsible for minting. Futurely it can also be fully ran on Golem network.</h4>
<h4>Soon, in-server items (nickname effects, Trainer Card effects, clans, etc) will be paired as NFTs.</h4>
<hr/>
<p>Disclaimer: xPOKE and the "Ethereum" Pokémon Showdown server have no affiliation with the GameFreak, Nintendo, The Pokémon Company nor the Ethereum blockchain. xPOKE and "Ethereum" PS server (as of Pokémon Showdown) are fan-made projects. This is an not-for-profit project. xPOKE is an 0 (zero) value token, with external value defined by external markets. PlaytoEarn means earning in-server currencies/tokens, not real money. xPOKE is not technically an cryptocurrency, but an token running on XDai blockchain, layer2 of the Ethereum blockchain. xPOKE's objective is to give true ownership on PokémonShowdown's in-server currencies and make them portable.</p>
<p>If Nintendo/Game Freak/The Pokémon Company and their lawiers have any concern, can contact me at <a href="mailto:daniellmesquita@protonmail.com">daniellmesquita@protonmail.com</a>, althought xPOKE is decentralized and not based in the Pokémon franchise, but in the fan-game Pokémon Showdown. We urge anyone that have xPOKE tokens to vote in our DAO to takedown xPOKE if this is the desire of the copyright holders of Pokémon (althought they should first do it to Pokémon Showdown, which we're based off, and prohibit their API to permit servers to issue their currencies. The work of xPOKE is just to convert these in-server currencies into their paired tokens, xPOKE tokens). xPOKE is not an security token (but an utility token) and had no crowdsale/ICO.</p>
